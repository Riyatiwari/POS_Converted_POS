## Migration Guidelines

### 1. File Organization
- Controllers must be placed in the `Controllers/` directory
- Views must be placed in the `Views/` directory under appropriate feature folders
- Models must be placed in the `Models/` directory
- Services must be placed in the `Services/` directory
- Static files must be placed in the `wwwroot/` directory

### 2. Code Migration Rules
- Preserve all business logic functionality
- Maintain exact UI appearance and behavior
- Convert VB.NET to C# using proper syntax
- Use dependency injection instead of direct instantiation
- Replace WebForms controls with HTML/Tag Helpers
- Convert code-behind to controller actions
- Move business logic to services
- Use async/await for database operations

### 3. Report Migration
- Preserve all report parameters and filters
- Maintain exact report layout and formatting
- Convert Telerik Report definitions to compatible format
- Preserve all calculations and aggregations
- Maintain role-based access control

### 4. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't place controllers outside Controllers folder
- Don't place views outside Views folder
- Don't mix service interfaces and implementations
- Don't skip dependency injection
- Don't hardcode database connections
- Don't ignore role-based security
- Don't skip parameter validation
- Don't ignore error handling

### 5. Testing Guidelines
- Test all converted functionality
- Verify report data accuracy
- Test all filters and parameters
- Verify role-based access
- Test error scenarios
- Compare output with original system

### 6. Documentation Strategy
- Create module-specific documentation for each migrated component
- Maintain root-level documentation in the Docs folder
- Update migration progress after each module completion
- Document known issues and their resolutions
- Keep track of pending migrations
- Document all architectural decisions
- Never assume or hallucinate features - migrate only what exists
- Avoid over-engineering - stick to the original functionality

### 7. Migration Verification Process
1. Pre-Migration Checklist
   - Document original functionality
   - Capture UI screenshots
   - List all features and parameters
   - Document business logic
   - Note any special cases or edge conditions

2. During Migration
   - Follow proper file organization
   - Maintain exact business logic
   - Preserve UI layout and behavior
   - Keep all existing functionality
   - Document any challenges or decisions

3. Post-Migration Verification
   - Compare UI with original screenshots
   - Test all features and parameters
   - Verify calculations and data
   - Check role-based access
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify integrations
   - Document any differences or improvements

4. Documentation Update
   - Update module-specific documentation
   - Update migration progress
   - Document any known issues
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Create/update user guides
